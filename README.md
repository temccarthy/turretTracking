# turretTracking

This a project that leverages facial recoginition and the Kinect's skeleton tracking to track people in real time.

To add faces to the encoding list, add them to their own folder in ./pics/. Your file structure should look like this:
```
project
│   README.md
│   main.py
|   ...
│
└───person_one
│   │   1.jpg
│   │   2.jpg
|   |   ...
│   
└───person_two
    │   1.jpg
    │   2.jpg
    |   ...
```
File names are irrelevant, make sure the folders that contain the pictures are all of the same person
